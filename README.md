# TryHackMe Notes
My notes and scripts for TryHackMe

In the summer of 2021 I finished my 365 day streak badge after dedicating a full year of hacking on the TryHackMe platform.  Ranking in the top 500 globally and top 50 in my country.  During that time I learned how to be a better security professional and understand some of the tools that an attacker may use to take advantage of a system.
