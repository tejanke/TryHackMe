# Task 1 - Credit
This room material is largely based on slides made by Dr. Ruben Niederhagen and Dr. Andreas HÃ¼lsing from the Technical University of Eindhoven

# Task 2 - Intro
Passwords are one of three forms of authentication, what you know.  The others are what you are and what you have.  Passwords were first used in 1961 at MIT.  When passwords are securely stored, they are saved as a hash.  There are two types of attacks against passwords, online and offline.  Online attacks are easily mitigated with timeouts.  Offline attacks are better from the perspective of the attacker and are mostly impossible to defend against

# Task 3 - Good Passwords
Password complexity and not reusing it is important.  Linux has a password generator called pwgen

# Task 4 - Password Attacks
Attack types
* Guessing - guess a password using known attributes of the target
* Dictionary Attack - use a common wordlist like rockyou.txt
* Rainbow Tables - use pre-computed hashes of already brute forced passwords 
* Brute-Force - process all combinations of a-z A-Z 0-9 symbols, etc

# Task 5 - Password Storage and Defense
Storage
* Plain text - this is the worst possible storage method
* Hashed - hashing, or better salted hashing is the preferred method of storage

Hashes for the same password with different users are the same, salted hashes for the same password with different users are different

# Task 6 - Different Hashes and Cracking Speeds
A key derivation function is a method to generate secrets from a given secret.  They include:
* Key separation - derive multiple independent passwords from a master password
* Key stretching - create a longer password using a shorter one
* Key whitening - key with fixed random bits

Key stretching algorithms:
* PBKDF2 - Pasword-Based Key Derivation Function 2
  * pros : iterations can be adjusted
  * cons : fast hashing, uses little memory, low protection against hardware attacks

* bcrypt
  * pros : cost factor that adapts with computing power, uses an expensive function
  * cons : uses little memory, medium protection against hardware attacks

* scrypt
  * pros : cost factor for time and memory, based on PBKDF2
  * cons : cost factor bound to one parameter, too new

* argon2
  * pros : memory and time cost controlled separately, multiple versions, winner of hashing competition
  * cons : newer than scrypt

Crypto ripens with age

# Task 7 - Advice
Advice from Bruce Schneier:
* Never reuse a password you care about
* Don't bother updating your password unless it has been compromised
* Beware of secret questions
* If 2FA is available, use it

# Task 8 - Conclusion
