# Task 1 - Intro
Intro

# Task 2 - Automated vs manual vulnerability research
* Automated scans save time, but can build reliance on the tool instead of knowing what you are looking for
* Manual scanning takes a lot of time, but will provide you with more stealth when trying to hide yourself in a scenario
* Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner
* Metasploit is a popular exploitation framework that also includes vulnerability scanners
* Example vulnerabilities
    * security misconfiguration
    * broken access controls
    * insecure deserialization
    * injection

# Task 3 - Finding manual exploits
* There are many vulnerability research databases that include exploits and other proof of concepts
    * Rapid7
        * https://www.rapid7.com/db/
    * GitHub
        * https://github.com/
    * Searchsploit
        * Searchsploit is an offline tool installed by default with Kali that you can use at the CLI

# Task 4 - Example exploitation
* The example walks you through looking at a poc.  Inside the poc you have to change IP and port parameters and then run the exploit.

# Task 5 - Practical
* In the practical you are tasked with exploiting the vulnerable CMS.  Searching google for the CMS name and version with the keyword of exploit lands you at exploit-db.  From here one of the exploits is an RCE.  From the attackbox, copy the exploit code into a new Python script.  Execute the exploit code and point to the vulnerable CMS installation.  RCE.
