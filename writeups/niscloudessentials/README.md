# Task 1 - Intro
Before the term "cloud", you could outsource hosting or colocation of physical resources to other companies like Level 3 (Lumen) or Equinix who had/have data centers around the world.  These companies would charge you monthly for physical space or to rent their equipment.  The "cloud" is a new marketing term used for pretty much this same thing, except at a much larger scale.  In the old days a host would have a rack or two, then it built up to a row of cabinets, then rows and rows of cabinets, and then buildings full of cabinets, etc.  In the transition towards the building full of cabinets and when virtualization took off, larger players began selling resources and services in the "cloud".
