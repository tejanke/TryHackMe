# Task 5 - SHIELD
Shield is an active defense knowledge base MITRE is developing to capture and organize what we are learning about active defense and adversary engagement.  Shield Active Defense is similar to the ATT&CK Matrix, but the tactics and techniques provided to us enable us to trap and engage with an adversary active within the network

# Task 6 - ATT&CK Emulation Plans
MITRE formed CTID - Center of Threat-Informed Defense.  This organization consists of various companies and vendors to conduct research on cyber threats and their TTPs

https://mitre-engenuity.org/ctid/

The Adversary Emulation Library is a public library making adversary emulation plans a free resource for blue/red teamers.  The 3 ATT&CK Emulation Plans available are: APT3, APT29, and FIN6

# Task 7 - ATT&CK and Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence (TI) or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the information, or TTPs, attributed to the adversary.  By using threat intelligence, as defenders, we can make better decisions about defense
