# Task 1 - What is networking
Networks connect things and can be found everywhere from public transportation, to postal systems, and the power grid.  Networks can be used to gather data, deliver electricity, or connect your phone

# Task 2 - What is the Internet
The Interenet is a network of networks, the largest really.  The first iteration of the Internet started in 1960 and was known as the ARPANET, it was funded by the DOD.  In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web to be used on this network, it was a catalyst for the modern web and Internet of today

# Task 3 - Identifying devices on a network
Devices on a network have two primary means of identification, a MAC address, and an IP address.  An IP address, usually still referring to IPv4, is a set of 4 numbers called octets divded by dots.  Each number can have a value between 0 and 255.  The IP address should be unique and they are classified in two main systems, either public or private.  Public IP addresses are used to communicate on the public Internet and are provided by your Internet Service Provider.  Private IP addresses are used in your local home or work network and are assigned by your router or company's network administrator.  There are a total of 2^32 unique IP addresses available, or about 4.2 billion.  MAC addresses are burned in and assigned to a network interface card.  They generally do not change and identify a device on a local segment.  The MAC address is made up of 16 hexadecimal characters split in two's by a colon

# Task 4 - Ping - ICMP
Ping is a fundamental tool used for network testing.  It uses the ICMP protocol and measures the round trip time an ICMP packet takes to get from your computer to a remote computer, and back again.  The statistics with the ping command are displayed in milliseconds
