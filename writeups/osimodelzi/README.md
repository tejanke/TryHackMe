# Task 1 - Intro
* OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnect
  * a 7 layer model that describes different functions and designs for network communication
* OSI Model Layers
  * 7 - Application
  * 6 - Presentation
  * 5 - Session
  * 4 - Transport
  * 3 - Network
  * 2 - Data Link
  * 1 - Physical

# Task 2 - OSI Model Layer 7 - Application
* OSI Model Layer 7 - the Application layer - is among the most familiar, it is what you as an end user interact with using an interface such as a GUI or CLI.  Some examples of things on the application layer include email clients, web browsers, file serving clients, telnet clients, and SSH clients

# Task 3 - OSI Model Layer 6 - Presentation
* OSI Model Layer 6 - the Presentation layer - acts as a translator for data passed down from the Applicat Layer.  This is where formatting and some encodings happen, such as MIME, TLS, and SSL

# Task 4 - OSI Model Layer 5 - Session
* OSI Model Layer 5 - the Session layer - after data is translated or formatted, a session will need to be maintained for the communication.  The session layer maintains that synchronization and overview of the packets in flight

# Task 5 - OSI Model Layer 4 - Transport
* OSI Model Layer 4 - the Transport layer - TCP and UDP live at this layer that is responsible for the reliable or unreliable transport of the data.  Ports live here

# Task 6 - OSI Model Layer 3 - Network
* OSI Model Layer 3 - the Network layer - routing packets across the network occurs here.  IP addresses live here

# Task 7 - OSI Model Layer 2 - Data Link
* OSI Model Layer 2 - the Data Link layer - focuses on physical addressing of frames with MAC addresses

# Task 8 - OSI Model Layer 1 - Physical
* OSI Model Layer 1 - the Physical layer - references the physical components of the network, transmission using electrical signals, RF, or light
