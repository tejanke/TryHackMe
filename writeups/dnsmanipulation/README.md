# Task 4 - What is DNS?
DNS - Domain Name System - resolves domain names with IP addresses.  DNS servers are distributed around the world and translate something.com into an IP address.  DNS root name servers sit at the top of the DNS hierarchy.  Below the root servers are the TLD servers.  Below them are the actual domain servers
