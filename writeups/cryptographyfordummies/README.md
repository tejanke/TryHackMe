# Task 1 - Intro
Intro

# Task 2 - Types of Cryptography
* Symmetric
  * encryption
  * decryption
  * key
  * encryption and decryption keys are the same
  * fast
* Asymmetric
  * public key used for encryption
  * private key used for decryption
  * encryption and decryption keys are different
  * slower than symmetric

# Task 3 - What is a hash
Hashes are long strings of letters and numbers that are generated by hashing algorithms and are not reversible.  A few example hashing algorithms are MD5 and SHA

# Task 4 - Decoding and Encoding
Encoding is not encryption.  Encoded data can be decoded immediately without keys.  A popular encoding is Base64

# Task 5 - Conclusion
