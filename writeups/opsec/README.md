# task 1 - intro
* OPSEC - operations security
* OPSEC - systematic and proven process by which potential adversaries can be denied information about capabilities and intentions by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified evidence of the planning and execution of sensitive activities
* OPSEC is a process
* OPSEC process five steps
    * identify critical information
    * analyze threats
    * analyze vulnerabilities
    * assess risks
    * apply appropriate countermeasures
* resources

# task 2 - critical information identification
* critical information includes any information that is obtained by the blue team that would hinder the red team's mission
* examples
    * client information
    * red team information
    * TTPs
    * OS, cloud provider, C2 framework in use
    * IP addresses
    * domain names
    * hosted websites
* resources
    * https://pentoo.github.io/

# task 3 - threat analysis
* threat analysis - identifying potential adversaries, their intentions, and capabilities
* questions to answer
    * who is the adversary
    * what are the goals of the adversary
    * what TTPs does the adversary use
    * what critical info has the adversary obtained
* resources

# task 4 - vulnerability analysis
* an opsec vulnerability exists when an adversary can obtain critical information, analyze findings, and act in a way that affects plans

# task 5 - risk assessment
* resources
    * https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/risk_assessment
* risk assessment - the process of identifying risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, the nation, resulting from the operation of an information system
* once a level of risk is identified, countermeasures can be reviewed to mitigate the risk

# task 6 - countermeasures
* countermeasures are designed to prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, provide an alternative interpretation of critical information or indicators, or deny the adversary's collection system

# task 7 - practical example
* five elements
    * identify critical information
    * analyze threats
    * analyze vulnerabilities
    * assess risk
    * apply appropriate countermeasures

# task 8 - summary
