# Task 1 - How websites work
* Front End - client side - the way your browser renders a website
* Back End - server side - a server that processes the web request and responds

# Task 2 - HTML
Websites are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts.  HTML is the language websites are written in and use tags (elements) to tell the web browser how to display content.  A few important tags are:
* <!DOCTYPE html> - header
* <html> - root of the doucment
* <head> - info about the page
* <body> - content area
* <h1> - change font size
* <p> - paragraphs live here

Tags can contain classes which apply to all tags that use them, and IDs which are supposed to be unique for that specific tag

# Task 3 - JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a very popular language that can be used to control the content of the website.  JS can be used to control both dynamic and static content, JS scripts are initialized with the <script> tag

# Task 4 - Sensitive Data
Sensitive Data Exposure is when data is not protected properly.  When reviewing a website for security issues, always view the source

# Task 5 - HTML Injection
HTML Injection occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the website due to failing to sanitize the input.  Input sanitization is very important in order to stop malicious attempts at attacking the website
